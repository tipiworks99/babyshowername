## 📝 How the Form Works

The form is designed to help you generate cute, gender-specific baby names easily. Here's how it works:
#### 🪪 Name (Optional)   
- This field is mostly for aesthetic or possible expansion.  
- It’s not currently used for filtering suggestions.
#### 🔹 Gender (Required)
- Select **either "Boy" or "Girl"** — this tells the app what you think the gender is.
- If you skip this, the app will not proceed.
#### 🔹 Baby Name (At Least One Required)
- You **must enter at least one name** in either the **Boy name(s)** field or the **Girl name(s)** field.
- You can enter **multiple names**, separated by commas. Example:  
- _Boy name(s)_: `Arjun, Rohan, Veer`  
- _Girl name(s)_: `Sita, Meera, Anaya`
#### 🚀 Once the form is filled:
- Click **Submit** to get personalized name suggestions based on your inputs.
- If required fields are missing, the app will gently guide you with error messages (no screaming pop-ups, we promise 💖).
